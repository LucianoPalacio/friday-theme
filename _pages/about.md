    // your module code goes here
    var sum = 0 ;

    return {
        add:function() {
            sum = sum + 1;
            return sum;
        },

            return sum = 0;
        }
    }
}());

### Bootstrap Components

Here's a CSS component, it's an alert box with the info color:

<div class="alert alert-info">
    A simple info alert!
</div>

The spinner.

<div class="spinner-border text-dark mb-4" role="status">
  <span class="sr-only">Loading...</span>
</div>
